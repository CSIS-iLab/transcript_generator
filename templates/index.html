            Doing so will cause the program to start over, which will take

            >The time it takes to process a file is 15-30% of its length. A

            <span class="underline">ChatGTP3 has a word limit.</span>
            To generate your one-paragraph summary, this tool uses ChatGTP3,
            which has a limit of ~3000 words. To work within this limit,
            ChatGTP3 is not fed your entire transcript, but a lengthy
            first-draft summary generated by a separate AI tool.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="underline"
              >You will need to review the transcript for errors.</span
            >
            The AI will generate a complete transcript for you, but it may not
            spell every name or location correctly (ex: "Dr. Hammery"). If your
            event contains multiple speakers or presenters, it will label
            different speakers "Speaker A", "Speaker B", and so on. While it
            does a good job of differentiating between speakers, it does not
            "know" who is speaking and cannot label them by name.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="underline">You can still try ChatGTP4.</span>
            ChatGTP4 is able to process up to 25,000 words of text and create
            more sophisticated summaries and analysis. ChatGTP4 is not yet
            available for developers to build with, but you may interact with it
            via
            <a
              class="container-link"

            and Microsoft's new
            <a class="container-link" href="https://www.bing.com/new">Bing</a>
            chat. If you would like, you will be able to copy and paste the
            transcript that is generated for you on the next page into one of
            those tools.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="underline">You can ask for a new summary.</span>
            On the next page, if you are unhappy with your summary you will have
            the chance to request that the AI try again. You will have the
            option to use the same default prompt, or submit your own prompt.
            Note the variation in the result will be limited, in order to
            prevent the AI from inventing things that are inaccurate.
